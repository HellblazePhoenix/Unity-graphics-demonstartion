/*
 Summary:
 The game will be a phycis based platformer where the player will
 have to jump across a set of platforms to get to a finish line
 the twist is the player can only jump on platforms that are the 
 same colour as them.

 Game elements: 
 A shader to make platforms transparent when the player can't jump
 on them while causing their outline to glow in their colour.
 
 A UI with buttons to change the player colour.

 A game over event trigger on a death box underneath the course 
 
 A win trigger at the finish.
 
 Win/Lose UI element.
 
 
 
 (Ordered)TODO:
 1. implement UI
 2. create finish line
 3. create scripts for the game mechanics
 4. 
 5.
 
 
 Accomplished tasks:
 1. Player movement and animations done
 2. Camera controller done
 3. create prefabs for platforms using shaders done
 
 
 Optional:
 1. Add shaders to the deathbox to make it look hazardous (i.e lava, poison, spikes).
 2. make the surroundings like walls and non game platforms look like enviromental elements.
 3. create levels and a starting menu with a level select and options screen.
 4.
 
 Ideas:
 Hopefully I'll be able to use either layers or active/inactve to control the collisions.

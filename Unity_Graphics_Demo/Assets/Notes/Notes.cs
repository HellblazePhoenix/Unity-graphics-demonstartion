 Summary:
 The game will be a phycis based platformer where the player will
 have to jump across a set of platforms to get to a finish line
 the twist is the player can only jump on platforms that are the 
 same colour as them.

 Game elements: 
 A shader to make platforms transparent when the player can't jump
 on them while causing their outline to glow in their colour.
 
 A UI with buttons to change the player colour.

 A game over event trigger on a death box underneath the course 
 
 A win trigger at the finish.
 
 Win/Lose UI element.

 Accomplished tasks:
 1. Player movement and animations done
 2. Camera controller done
 3. create prefabs for platforms using shaders done
 4. Added a game UI
 5. Created a finish line platform
 6. Death collider unrefined done
 7. State change scripts for player and platforms done
 8. controls finished  
 9. create script for the finish line
 10. create win UI
 11. create script for the Win UI
 Optional:
 1. Add shaders to the deathbox to make it look hazardous (i.e lava, poison, spikes). Easiest would be lava
 2. make the surroundings like walls and non game platforms look like enviromental elements.
 3. create levels and a starting menu with a level select and options screen.
 4. Create a timer for how long it takes to finish the course
 5. Create a save file with unlocked levels and best times+
 6. Create achievements add them to the the menu and 
 
 Ideas:
 Hopefully I'll be able to use either layers or active/inactve to control the collisions.
 
 I could also make a white state where all platforms are ghosts
 could be good if I want to make walls/barriers
 
 If I get around to doing the lava shader then remove the skybok and directional light and turn the level into a cave

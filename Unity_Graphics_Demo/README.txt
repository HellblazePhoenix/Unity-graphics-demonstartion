There is a Notes section in a code file in a folder named Notes in the assets folder, 
the reason it's a code file was so I could keep it in an easily accessible tab to edit
while working on scripts. Also I know the game is a terrible experience to play especially
the camera control but for an initial version with no refinements or optimisation it
should be fine.
